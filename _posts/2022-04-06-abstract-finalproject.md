My dataset, “‘Cyborg’ in Popular Cultural Criticism,” will examine uses of the term “cyborg” in popular U.S. culture literary magazines. Why? While I am compelled by [criticisms in feminist and disability theory](https://dsq-sds.org/article/view/3995/3540) of the use of “cyborg” as a unilateral metaphor for futurity that invokes the disabled body but evades the [lived physicality](https://granta.com/common-cyborg/), cost, and potential complications of medical technology, I want to investigate how much the word appears outside of Theory. That is, while more problematic elements of [Donna Haraway’s employment of “cyborg”](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fictionnownarrativemediaandtheoryinthe21stcentury/manifestly_haraway_----_a_cyborg_manifesto_science_technology_and_socialist-feminism_in_the_....pdf) continue (I say optimistically) to fall out of fashion, I am interested in how this term is used in culture writing and criticism that does not necessarily subscribe to a particular Theory label and instead addresses the wider media-interested public. 

  I make this distinction between Theory and popular criticism with the knowledge that widely circulated culture and literary magazines are not separate from the Academy, but rather exist as a site between the academy and pop culture. Further, I understand that “cyborg” in the context of popular media is usually not meant to connote disabled embodiment and often reifies distinctions between human and machine. I invoke disability next to “cyborg” because of how the two have been associated in theory and in mainstream news coverage to refer to adaptive technology, and how the label of cyborg has been (re)claimed by disabled and chronically ill writers (Kafer 107). My primary interest here is more broadly how machines are figured with, next to, and in opposition to the (human) body in the popular critical imagination, whether disability is consciously invoked or not. As such, I will limit my search for the application of “cyborg,” then, to the following publications: The Atlantic, The New Yorker, Salon, Los Angeles Review of Books, New York Review of Books, and The Nation. 
  My dataset will take the form of a Spreadsheet (.csv file), which will include the following fields: “author,” “title,” “date,” “genre,” “frequency,” “relative context,” “part of speech,” and finally, “link.” “Genre” will refer not to magazine-specific classifications, but rather indicate whether each piece, in my understanding, falls into the category of criticism–of literature, film, music, or video games–or nonfiction essay (that which critiques culture in general but not a media object in particular). “Frequency” will refer to the number of times each piece of writing uses “cyborg,” “cyborgs,” “cyborgian,” or “cyborg’s.” “Relative context” will refer whether references to the “cyborg” exist: 1) as metaphor to describe cultural phenomenon and not applied to human actors; 2) as adjectives or adverbs for human behavior;  3) to refer to bodily augmentation, transformation, or capacitation; or 4) to refer to fictional characters.
  
  To obtain the aforementioned data and metadata, I will copy all returned essay links (yielded by my search in each website) into [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/). This will first allow me to mine for and copy information into the “title,” “date,” “author,” and “frequency” fields. It will then allow me to isolate the phrases surrounding each use of “cyborg” in order to decide on classifications within (and thus populate) the “relative context” field. While this dataset will be quite labor intensive on the front end, its maintenance should not be. Because of the weekly timeline on which each magazine operates, and relative simplicity of each field, it seemingly should not be very labor intensive to continue building the dataset as new publications that refer to a/the/being “cyborg” circulate. 
Through this dataset, I aim to make visible where and in what general context “cyborg” features in the popular literary and cultural imagination, to provide myself and other researchers the ability to investigate applications of the term further. Due to the fact that the essays reflected in this dataset are not in the public domain, however, I will necessarily avoid original phrasing and complete summary in contextualization. In effect, the final product will likely yield a set of critical reading suggestions rather than a set of claims. What I mean by this is that the dataset will offer places to look in order to analyze the way technology is figured with, against, and next to the body in mainstream criticism, and to ultimately ask whether critics have found a way to address adaptive and augmentative technologies and the humans who use them as something other than heroic, metaphoric, or intentionally cryptic. 

  While there are many compelling comparative, qualitative studies related to race, gender, and embodiment across media that incorporate AI (see, for example, *Whiteness in AI* by Stephen Cave and Kanta Dihal or *Gender and Environment in Science Fiction* by Bridgitte Barclay (ed)), it is hard to find comparable computational studies that address the use of “cyborg” within mainstream media and criticism. The use of “cyborg” in mainstream culture writing, though, might be compared against the use of artificial intelligence in science and speculative fiction [literature](http://www.isfdb.org/#:~:text=The%20ISFDB%20is%20a%20community,content%20listings%2C%20and%20forthcoming%20books.) and [film](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/AIMOVIES/AImovies.htm#ai), for which there exist fairly extensive online databases (see linked). Even then, however, further mining would be required to locate specific applications of “cyborg” within the media said databases enumerate, and perhaps more importantly, to extend this inquiry into science fiction would be to evade how writers understand the place of body-machine interaction in the real socio-poltical sphere. Thus, the existence of this dataset might also beg the question: is there enough attention being paid to technologically aided, rehabilitated, or augmented bodies *in* literature *outside of* popular science fiction? And/or when we, as literary critics, talk about cyborgian figures in speculative fiction, do we focus more on  the affordances and consequences of technology *in general* than who is being capacitated or debilitated in the process of biomedical intervention and how? Finally, with respect to future adaptation, the steps necessary for this particular dataset could be repurposed to create a separate directory that reflects the use of cyborg/cyborgianism by self-identifying disabled authors exclusively. Such a product would facilitate an amplification of disabled authors, as disabledwriters.com beautifully does [here](https://disabledwriters.com/the-database/?listpage=1&instance=1). In sum, I want this dataset to help facilitate an examination of the intersection of “cyborg” across media and critical fields.
